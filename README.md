## Introduction

The React-Portfolio Template is a modern, responsive portfolio template built with React and Tailwind CSS. It includes sections for projects, skills, testimonials, and contact information, making it easy to showcase your work and skills.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get started with the React-Portfolio Template:

1. **Clone the Repository**

## Customization

To customize your portfolio, follow these steps:

   Open `src/App.jsx` and update the personal information, such as your name, projects, skills, and contact details.
